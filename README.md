# Security Blue Team Network Analysis with Wireshark-SBT-PCAP2
## Introduction
Network analysis involves collecting, monitoring and analyzing network traffic, such as DNS traffic and other protocols like TCP/UDP/ICMP to detect and investigate security incidents. It involves using tools such as Wireshark and command-line tools(tshark) to capture network traffic, analyze it for suspicious activities, detect intrusions, and understand the network behaviors.

## Pre-requisites
- A Linux Operating System(Ubuntu/Debian)
- Understanding of networking basics and protocols
- Wireshark installed(for GUI inspection)
- Experience with the command-line

## Lab Set-up and Tools
- A computer running a Linux distribution(e.g Ubuntu/Kali/Parrot)
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) installed(i.e if on a Windows system)
- Network traffic or sample pcap files

### Installing Wireshark
1. Update and upgrade your package list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
2. Install Wireshark(i.e if not installed on your system)
   ```bash
    sudo apt install wireshark
   ```
3. Import the PCAP file into Wireshark for analysis
## Exercise
### Exercise 2: Finding the activities from the SBT-PCAP2 file
1. What is the WebAdmin password?
2. What is the version number of the attackerâ€™s FTP server?
3. Which port was used to gain access to the victim Windows host?
4. What is the name of a confidential file on the Windows host?
5. What is the name of the log file that was created at 4:51 AM on the Windows host?
   

## Conclusion
After completing this exercise, I was able to filter packets from the "display filter" in Wireshark to find specific results based on the activities given to me. I finally learnt to capture and monitor network traffic during the course. These skills are essential in performing network forensics investigation and analysis in the SOC role.
